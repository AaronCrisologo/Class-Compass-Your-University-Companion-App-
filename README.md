## ***Project Overview***
  Class Compass is a comprehensive mobile application designed to streamline and enhance the student experience by consolidating critical academic information and updates into a single, user-friendly interface. Built using the Flutter framework, Class Compass is intended to provide students with real-time notifications about class cancellations, school holidays, emergency announcements, and other vital information that could affect their academic schedule. The application will feature a robust login system that detects the student's department, ensuring that each user receives tailored updates relevant to their specific academic environment. In addition to providing timely alerts, Class Compass will also aggregate essential information such as the school's academic calendar and national holidays, enabling students to stay organized and informed. Furthermore, the app will empower students to create and manage their own class schedules, with the ability to mark and track cancellations as they occur. With additional features such as event reminders, resource links, emergency contact information, and instructor announcements, Class Compass aims to be an indispensable tool for every student navigating their academic journey.

## ***Objectives:***

  The objectives of Class Compass are multifaceted, targeting both immediate and long-term benefits for the student body. Firstly, the app aims to deliver real-time notifications for class cancellations, school events, and emergency announcements, ensuring that students are promptly informed about any changes that might impact their academic schedule. 
Secondly, Class Compass will provide a centralized repository of critical academic information, such as the school’s academic calendar and national holidays, enabling students to plan their studies and personal activities effectively. Thirdly, the app will include a customizable schedule management feature that allows students to create, modify, and monitor their class schedules, with an easy-to-use interface for marking and tracking class cancellations. 
Additionally, by incorporating event reminders, resource links, and emergency contact information, Class Compass will serve as a comprehensive academic companion that supports students in various aspects of their university life. Finally, the app aims to foster better communication between instructors and students through dedicated announcement sections, ensuring that important updates from faculty members are never missed. Overall, the goal of Class Compass is to enhance student productivity, reduce informational barriers, and create a more connected and efficient academic community.

## **Purpose:**

  The primary purpose of Class Compass is to bridge the communication gap between students and the various administrative and academic departments within a university. In the fast-paced academic environment, students often find it challenging to keep up with sudden changes, such as class cancellations due to unforeseen circumstances or important announcements that require immediate attention. 

  By centralizing all such information in one accessible platform, Class Compass seeks to alleviate the stress and confusion associated with these sudden changes, ensuring that students are always in the loop. Additionally, the app aims to enhance the overall academic experience by providing tools that help students manage their schedules more effectively and stay informed about important events and deadlines. By leveraging the capabilities of Flutter, Class Compass will offer a seamless and visually appealing user experience across multiple devices, making it easier for students to access the information they need anytime, anywhere.

## **Problems Addressed**
The Class Compass project addresses several key challenges faced by university students and academic institutions, aiming to enhance the overall academic experience through its innovative mobile application:

**Information Fragmentation:** Currently, students often struggle with fragmented sources of information regarding class cancellations, emergency announcements, and academic schedules. This fragmentation can lead to confusion and missed opportunities, impacting students' ability to plan effectively.

**Communication Inefficiencies:** Inefficient communication channels between students and academic departments can delay the dissemination of critical information, such as changes in class schedules or emergency alerts. This lack of timely communication can disrupt students' daily routines and academic progress.

**Resource Accessibility:** Access to essential academic resources, such as departmental events, academic calendars, and emergency contact information, may not be readily available or easily accessible to students when needed. This lack of accessibility can hinder students' ability to stay informed and engaged in university activities.

## ***Project Description***
### ***Scope:***

The scope of the Class Compass project is focused on developing a front-end mobile application using Flutter that enhances the academic experience for university students. The application will include the following features:

**User Authentication and Personalization:**
Students should be able to login with their own provided school accounts to authenticate with the application and receive personalized content based on their department.

**Notifications:**
An interface for displaying real-time notifications about class cancellations, emergency announcements, and other critical updates.

**Customizable Schedule Planner:**
Automatically detect the user’s location using GPS or network services.
Allow users to manually search for other locations.

**Event and Academic Calendar Aggregation:**
A section that aggregates and displays the university’s academic calendar, national holidays, and departmental events.

**Resource Links and Emergency Contacts:**
An integrated section with links to valuable academic resources and emergency contact information.


### ***Acknowledging Limitations:***
**No Backend Integration:**
The project will not involve any backend development. All data used in the application will be static or mocked, and there will be no real-time data fetching or database interactions.

**Limited Real-Time Functionality:**
While the app will include a design for real-time notifications, the actual implementation of real-time data updates and push notifications will not be covered in this phase.

**Static Data:**
The academic calendar, event information, and other data displayed in the app will be hardcoded or stored locally within the app for demonstration purposes.

**No Persistent Storage:**
User-generated data, such as custom schedules and marked class cancellations, will not be saved persistently. Any data entered will be lost once the app is closed.

**Simplified Authentication:**
The login system will be designed to simulate user authentication and personalization but will not involve actual user verification or secure credential storage.

**No Network Security:**
Since the project does not involve backend interaction, network security measures like data encryption and secure API communication will not be implemented.

## ***Climate Action Commitment:***
The Class Compass project aligns with **Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education)**, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.

## ***Technologies***
• **Flutter Framework:** Flutter will serve as the primary framework for developing the mobile application's front-end. Flutter enables rapid development of cross-platform applications with a single codebase, ensuring consistency across Android and iOS devices.

• **Dart Programming Language:** 
Dart, the programming language used with Flutter, will be employed for writing the application's logic and user interface components. Dart's efficiency in handling UI rendering and business logic makes it well-suited for mobile app development.

• **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** 
**VS Code** will be used as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and testing the Flutter application. Its robust Flutter and Dart extensions simplify development tasks and provide essential tools for efficient coding.

• **Version Control System:** 
Git will be utilized for version control, enabling collaborative development, tracking changes, and managing codebase updates throughout the project lifecycle. **GitHub** will serve as the remote repository hosting service.

• **Mock Data and Assets:** 
Static data and mock assets, including academic calendars, event information, and departmental resources, will be stored locally within the application. These will be accessed and displayed dynamically to simulate real-time updates and functionality.
