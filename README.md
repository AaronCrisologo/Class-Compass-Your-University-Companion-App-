Project Overview:
WeatherWise is a cross-platform weather application developed using Flutter. The app aims to provide users with accurate and personalized weather information based on their location. It will be available on both iOS and Android platforms.

## ***Objectives:***
**Real-Time Weather Data:**
Fetch real-time weather data from a reliable weather API.
Display current conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) for the user’s location.

**Hourly and Daily Forecasts:**
Provide detailed hourly and daily weather forecasts.
Include information such as temperature trends, precipitation chances, and wind conditions.

**Location Services:**
Automatically detect the user’s location using GPS or network services.
Allow users to manually search for other locations.

**Customization Options:**
Enable users to set preferences (e.g., temperature units, dark/light mode).
Personalize the app’s appearance and features.

**Severe Weather Alerts:**
Notify users about severe weather conditions (storms, heavy rain, snow, etc.).
Ensure safety by providing timely alerts.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of WeatherWise is to empower users with accurate weather insights, helping them make informed decisions based on current and forecasted conditions. Whether planning outdoor activities, travel, or daily routines, users can rely on this app for reliable weather information.
## ***Project Description***
Scope:
**Weather Data Retrieval:**
Fetch real-time weather data from a reliable weather API.
Display current conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) for the user’s location.

**Forecast Information:**
Provide detailed hourly and daily weather forecasts.
Include information such as temperature trends, precipitation chances, and wind conditions.

**Location Services:**
Automatically detect the user’s location using GPS or network services.
Allow users to manually search for other locations.

**Customization Options:**
Enable users to set preferences (e.g., temperature units, dark/light mode).
Personalize the app’s appearance and features.

**Severe Weather Alerts:**
Notify users about severe weather conditions (storms, heavy rain, snow, etc.).


Limitations:
**Geographical Coverage:**
The app’s accuracy depends on the coverage and reliability of the weather API.

**Data Latency:**
Real-time data updates may have a slight delay due to API response times.

**Battery Usage:**
Continuous location tracking and data retrieval can impact device battery life.

**Localized Features:**
Advanced features like hyper-local forecasts (street-level accuracy) may not be feasible without additional data sources.

**Design Complexity:**
Balancing aesthetics with functionality is crucial.

## ***Sustainable Development Goals 13 Climate Action:***
WeatherWise contributes by providing accurate weather information to users. By helping individuals make informed decisions related to climate variability, extreme weather events, and safety precautions, the app indirectly supports climate resilience. Additionally, WeatherWise can raise awareness about climate-related challenges and encourage sustainable practices.
