WeatherWise is an innovative, weather application meticulously crafted using the robust Flutter framework. WeatherWise stands out with its commitment to delivering precise and tailored weather insights. Leveraging the power of the Open Weather Map API, the app ensures that users receive real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, directly pertinent to their specific location.

## ***Objectives:***
**Real-Time Weather Data:**
Fetch real-time weather data from a reliable weather API.
Display current conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) for the user’s location.

**Hourly and Daily Forecasts:**
Provide detailed hourly and daily weather forecasts.
Include information such as temperature trends, precipitation chances, and wind conditions.

**Location Services:**
Automatically detect the user’s location using GPS or network services.
Allow users to manually search for other locations.

**Customization Options:**
Enable users to set preferences (e.g., temperature units, dark/light mode).
Personalize the app’s appearance and features.

**Severe Weather Alerts:**
Notify users about severe weather conditions (storms, heavy rain, snow, etc.).
Ensure safety by providing timely alerts.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of WeatherWise is to empower users with accurate weather insights, helping them make informed decisions based on current and forecasted conditions. Whether planning outdoor activities, travel, or daily routines, users can rely on this app for reliable weather information.
